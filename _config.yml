          LIMHA is a real-time analysis of machine health that gathers real-time machine data using sensors and analyses the health of the machine with the help of AI-ML algorithms. The objective of the project is to detect any abnormality in the machine behaviour, probable error in any of the machine components and to predict probable failure before it happens to reduce downtime, maintenance cost, production delay, and any unfortunate incident due to machine failure. 
          
          Edge computing has been used which makes communication faster, enforces privacy, gives greater operational efficiency, and is having lower operating costs. It segregates the probable failure into multiple levels and then gives the root cause of the failure and generates alerts and recommendations which makes maintenance easily understandable and less time-consuming.

            Multiple face recognition from a single photograph and automatically saved and marked in an excel sheet. Technology: Principle Component Analysis, MATLAB, Neural Network. 
            Calculate the eigenvalue of the captured face image and compared it with that of the existing face images. If the eigenvalues match, then the recognition process will start soon. Using the PCA algorithm the following steps would be followed Find the face information of matched face image in the database.
            Update the log table with the corresponding face image and system time that makes the completion of attendance for individual students.
